      <title>New layers for Floflis: DNA and Home</title>

      <description>I would post that on day 3, but had other things to do. Thinking about Floflis powering routers (wireless), Core is a too much high layer.
Floflis DNA Then, Floflis DNA layer will get some things from Floflis Core (its installer, tree folder) while not having huge things such as NodeJS (making them optional to install; inside a router, possible to upgrade from DNA to Core).
Floflis Home Instead of upgrading from Floflis Basic (would work on Windows 95 machines) to Floflis Ultimate (heavyweight), it can have a middle stage for intermediate devices: Floflis Home.</description>

      <description>Day 1 I came to Floflis&amp;rsquo; GitHub organization and openned its &amp;ldquo;meta&amp;rdquo; repo, which contains issues referring to the whole OS; on it, organized its issues for the upcomming build 071 (moved issues to other milestones, and created new ones).
Organized issues page:
Organized build 071 milestone:
Also, did a audit with Lynis, for the security report of July:
Tried to compile/install Stacer (didn&amp;rsquo;t worked), for cleanning junk storage usage:</description>

      <description>Seeing the need to compress files to make smaller .ISO file, and to run Floflis in other platforms (routers, IoT, handheld gaming consoles), I had the idea of Floflis&amp;rsquo; Layers, which makes Floflis modular and lightweight.
Bellow are the layers explained:
Recipe Not a working layer, but it contains references of compilers (for any supported platform) and source-codes.
Core Very lightweight, can run from a router to even a Nintendo DS.</description>

      <title>.ISO of 17.4 GB! We need to compress it</title>

      <description>After deciding to start Floflis as a live distro/OS (bootable and usable right after recording it on flash drives), it needs to not be heavyweight. And after tunning it in upcoming builds (being even smaller), make it lightweight and modular, which will be explained in the next post (Floflis&amp;rsquo; Layers).
I&amp;rsquo;ve scanned bin, etc, lib, lib64, opt, root, sbin, srv, usr, var root directories, which will be used by live-linux scriptset to build the ISO.</description>

      <description>If you see the watermark in Floflis desktop, it points as build 051 (5 representing May month, and 1 representing its first build for the month), but we are in 27 June. 051 was postponned because of my incompetence (althought I were studying other things, useful like in other years of &amp;ldquo;ocious&amp;rdquo;), and build 061 is being postponned due to personal issues (my mom needing to use notebook to write - and right now is preventing me from writing this asking to write more, and staring like a guard).</description>

      <description>It were hard to work on Floflis&amp;rsquo; Blog (and Floflis itself, even more), as there were people with need to use my notebook for hours. But I could make it working 100%.
Now the header haves menus (for main site, manuals, source-code) and these menus and blog&amp;rsquo;s title are now fully translated.
Yes, I know the blog needs a favicon, a comment system (like Disqus), translations in all posts and new languages available.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I&amp;rsquo;ve left the whole day working on Floflis&amp;rsquo; blog. And today, at morning, in less than two hours I&amp;rsquo;ve personalized the whole blog.
It loads a local logo (were reading from Floflis site), haves its title (did it today), personalized menu items (needs translation), added Esperanto language (needs a pull request to Bootstrap theme), and added its first two posts with tags and categories.
I don&amp;rsquo;t see GoHugo as a good platform for building sites, not even for blogs, but for now it is being totally useful for building blogs.</description>

      <title>Electron security reports for Floflis&#39; pre-installed apps</title>

      <description>Some days ago I were studying about security auditors on Linux, firstly started with Electron apps auditing.
The first auditing tool (and currently the only I&amp;rsquo;m using) is Electronegativity by Doyensec.
Electronegativity had pointed vulnerabilities in all apps. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if they are really vulnerabilities or just JS best practices tips.
I&amp;rsquo;ve reported them to all developers, and they seemed skeptical, and ignored. But I&amp;rsquo;m committed to try to fix vulnerabilities in any app I develop for Floflis, specially its built-in apps.</description>

      <description>This is the first post on Floflis&amp;rsquo; Blog, testing if GoHugo with hugo-bootstrap theme works.
For some time I&amp;rsquo;m wanting to log the development of Floflis on its own blog. Now it seems to be possible ❤</description>

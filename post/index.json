Confused for a few hours, I came with the idea of accepting on making it a live Linux, booting with a default user (floflis), then asking for installation.\nYeah, installation will be the hard part. I can simply do a piggy install, making a HDD/SSD into a bootable pendrive directly from installation media, but it isn\u0026rsquo;t the best approach. It needs a installer like Ubuntu haves, and I\u0026rsquo;ll research about that. But maybe I reinvent the wheel and create my own installer, in HTML5; which is a huge work and not my focus for now.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAlso I\u0026rsquo;m looking at Floflis\u0026rsquo; root folders and seeing their storage space used. The first build probably will be 071, and the limit for ISO size will be 3,5 GB (will be decreased on next builds). I know the Live Linux will see more GB, but I need to reduce it by removing uneed packages (installable through Internet), and zipping others.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eI remember in 2007, when I were a Windows 98 user, did a draw of my own OS. In 2008-2011, created some versions of a paper+cardboard computer for kids (with a user, and a operator which acts as a CPU/programming interpreter/display manager). In 2011 modified my Windows 7, made the desktop in 3D (using Bumptomp, open-source) and tried to distribute this as a new OS, but thought on copyright and wanted to make my very own OS without basing on a proprietary OS. In 2012 used Linux for first time on my sister\u0026rsquo;s notebook (already heard about Puppy/Slax/Knoppix Linux in 2008) knew Open SUSE Linux and its SUSE Studio, then managed to build a OS based on that. \u003csup\u003e2014\u003c/sup\u003e\u0026frasl;\u003csub\u003e2015\u003c/sub\u003e thought on making my OS as HTML5, and Firefox OS would be the base; also had a hot discussion with my uncle when downloading CLI tools on his computer, to develop on base of Firefox OS. On 2017 returned to SUSE Studio, but in 2018 Open SUSE just f%cked their tool, enabling only high-skilled users to use it. Now I\u0026rsquo;m doing like on 2011: modifying a installed OS, but now open-source and without relyance on 3rd party things; and I don\u0026rsquo;t believe it will be launched. And my mom is stared monitoring what I do here, trying anything to replace me.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eAnd I can\u0026rsquo;t write more.\u003c/p\u003e\n"

But I did a lot for the blog even with limited hours to work, and when I should work on Floflis OS instead of on its blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest thing to announce about our blog: it now output news feed for reader apps (JsonFeed and RSS), and haves a search index in JSON (missing a search system and its input field in header). Also I\u0026rsquo;m working on the FrameworkJS theme for GoHugo while working on Floflis blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe News Feed widget in sidebar is also translated, and part of FrameworkJS theme. This theme also includes its RSS logo (in SVG) and logo/favicon. ‚ù§\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHope to tell news about Floflis instead of its blog \u0026lsquo;=\u0026rsquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n"

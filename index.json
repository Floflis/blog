But I could make it working 100%.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eNow the header haves menus (for main site, manuals, source-code) and these menus and blog\u0026rsquo;s title are now fully translated.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"/blog/img/posts/updated-blog-with-translations-and-rss-json-feed2.png\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eYes, I know the blog needs a favicon, a comment system (like Disqus), translations in all posts and new languages available. But I did a lot for the blog even with limited hours to work, and when I should work on Floflis OS instead of on its blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest thing to announce about our blog: it now output news feed for reader apps (JsonFeed and RSS), and haves a search index in JSON (missing a search system and its input field in header). Also I\u0026rsquo;m working on the FrameworkJS theme for GoHugo while working on Floflis blog.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eThe News Feed widget in sidebar is also translated, and part of FrameworkJS theme. This theme also includes its RSS logo (in SVG) and logo/favicon. ❤\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eHope to tell news about Floflis instead of its blog \u0026lsquo;=\u0026rsquo;\u003c/p\u003e\n"

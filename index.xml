      <description>It were hard to work on Floflis&amp;rsquo; Blog (and Floflis itself, even more), as there were people with need to use my notebook for hours. But I could make it working 100%.
Now the header haves menus (for main site, manuals, source-code) and these menus and blog&amp;rsquo;s title are now fully translated.
Yes, I know the blog needs a favicon, a comment system (like Disqus), translations in all posts and new languages available.</description>

      <description>Yesterday I&amp;rsquo;ve left the whole day working on Floflis&amp;rsquo; blog. And today, at morning, in less than two hours I&amp;rsquo;ve personalized the whole blog.
It loads a local logo (were reading from Floflis site), haves its title (did it today), personalized menu items (needs translation), added Esperanto language (needs a pull request to Bootstrap theme), and added its first two posts with tags and categories.
I don&amp;rsquo;t see GoHugo as a good platform for building sites, not even for blogs, but for now it is being totally useful for building blogs.</description>

      <description>Some days ago I were studying about security auditors on Linux, firstly started with Electron apps auditing.
The first auditing tool (and currently the only I&amp;rsquo;m using) is Electronegativity by Doyensec.
Electronegativity had pointed vulnerabilities in all apps. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if they are really vulnerabilities or just JS best practices tips.
I&amp;rsquo;ve reported them to all developers, and they seemed skeptical, and ignored. But I&amp;rsquo;m committed to try to fix vulnerabilities in any app I develop for Floflis, specially its built-in apps.</description>

      <description>This is the first post on Floflis&amp;rsquo; Blog, testing if GoHugo with hugo-bootstrap theme works.
For some time I&amp;rsquo;m wanting to log the development of Floflis on its own blog. Now it seems to be possible ‚ù§</description>

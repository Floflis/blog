      <description>Some days ago I were studying about security auditors on Linux, firstly started with Electron apps auditing.
The first auditing tool (and currently the only I&#39;m using) is Electronegativity by Doyensec.
Electronegativity had pointed vulnerabilities in all apps. I don&#39;t know if they are really vulnerabilities or just JS best practices tips.
I&#39;ve reported them to all developers, and they seemed skeptical, and ignored. But I&#39;m committed to try to fix vulnerabilities in any app I develop for Floflis, specially its built-in apps.</description>
